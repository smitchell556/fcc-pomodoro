      <p class="about">How does this timer work?</p>

      <p class="about">This timer is based on the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com" target="_blank">pomodoro technique</a>, which is a time-management method that alternates between periods of work and rest. During the first timer, work on a task until the timer ends. A second timer will begin that allows you to take a short break. The timer repeats indefinitely following this cycle. For each work period, you set a task to complete, if you complete that task before the timer is over, then spend the remaining time either perfecting the work you just completed or becoming more knowledgeable on the subject matter (i.e. read the documentation related to the finished task).</p>

      <p class="about">Why can't I set the work timer to less than 15 minutes?</p>

      <p class="about">The work timer can be set from 15 to 45 minutes and the break timer can be set from 5 to 15 minutes. The original pomodoro method suggests 25 minutes of work with a 5 minute break. This timer allows for more customization since everybody works a little differently. The goal is to get work done, so the work cycle can't be too short, hence the 15 minute cut off.</p>

      <p class="about">Why is the fourth break 25 minutes?</p>

      <p class="about">Traditionally, after completing four work cycles a 25 minute break is given. This helps prevent fatigue while working.</p>

      <p class="about">Why are there circles at the bottom of the page?</p>

      <p class="about">Those keep track of which work cycle you are on. One pomodoro is equal to one work cycle. The more pomodoro's you do the more you get done!</p>
